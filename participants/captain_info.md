## Assemble your team

Start assembling your team now!  

Don't have a team yet and looking for a team? Check out our [message board](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/therelay/).

## Enter your team

BY MARCH 1, ENTER YOUR TEAM (to avoid late fees).

Mail one nonrefundable $960/team (up to 12) check payable to The Relay. See [Contact Us](../about/who_we_are.html).

From March 2 until April 1, the team entry fee is $1080 (includes $10/runner late fee, except sponsor teams).

## Register your teammates

By March 8, check [Registered Teams](http://therelay.com/ru_teams.htm) for team name 
indicating entry fee has been processed and instruct up to 11 runners to register by 
selecting team name from drop down list.  

Each runner must enter his/her 10k minute/mile pace to allow start time calculations.

By April 15, two volunteers must register. If every runner on a team lives more than 
50 miles from any part of the course, the volunteer requirement is waived.   

Since a waiver is involved, captains that enter their runners or volunteers assume 
personal liability for each person entered.

## Fundraise

BY APRIL 15 (to avoid late fees), a mandatory $600/team ($50/runner) offline donations to ORU 
and corporate matching requests are due before a team may start. 

If checks/matching forms are not mailed by April 15 to allow processing, bring them to the start.
After April 15, bring donations and matching fund requests to registration at the Start. 
After teams meet the $600 minimum, donations may be mailed (even after April 15) or turned in at the Start.

## Get ready for the race!
