## WITH [ORGANS R US](http://therelay.com/re_ORUPledge.pdf) (ORU), THE GOLDEN GATE RELAY (GGR) PROMOTES DONATION

Since 1995, the transfer of the baton from runner to runner symbolizes the transfer of an organ from donor to recipient. Of 125,000 Americans waiting for organs, 18 die daily waiting for a donor.

## STORIES OF ORGAN DONATION FOLLOW

The 1996-1998 Relays were dedicated to [Delaney Corbitt](http://therelay.com/re_dedication.htm) (born 10/26/94). After Delaney received a kidney in 1997, President Clinton signed a GGR shirt for Delaney while runners crossed the finish.

The 2001-2004 Relays were dedicated to [Nicholas Green](http://therelay.com/re_dedication.htm) who donated organs to seven Italians. To thank the boy that saved her, [Maria Pia Pedala](http://therelay.com/re_dedication.htm), Nicholas' liver recipient, traveled from Italy to participate in the 2004 GGR. With an estimated promotional value of $10 million, Maria Pia's visit was covered by four television stations, including RAI from Italy, and 18 publications including USA Today, People Magazine and Readers Digest and discussed on David Letterman.
