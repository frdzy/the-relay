WHAT HAS 36 LEGS, 24 FEET AND RUNS ALL NIGHT?  

During the world's largest event promoting the need for organ donors, 12-member teams run 36 legs through 36 cities and across the Golden Gate Bridge at midnight. The transfer of the baton from runner to runner symbolizes the transfer of an organ from donor to recipient. Of 125,000 Americans waiting for organs, 18 die each day before a donor is found.
