March 8: deadline for runner registration (paces needed to calculate start times).  
April 15: deadline for volunteer registration.  
April 15: Racebooks (with forms, maps, rules) available on the [Captain's Page](http://therelay.com/ru_captains.htm).

## CAPTAIN INSTRUCTIONS

1. Register your team (requires team name) before March 1. 
	 Read [Overview](http://therelay.com/re_overview.htm) if a new captain. 
   Using their email/password, returning captains must enter a team name and update their user data. 
   Captains may not enter more than one team. 
2. Mail one nonrefundable $960 check ($1080 after March 1) with team name payable to
   [The Relay](about/who_we_are.html) postmarked by March 1 or pay with credit card. 
3. After check processing, team name will appear at [Registered Teams](http://therelay.com/ru_teams.htm). 
   Confirmations will not be sent. With credit card payments, teams will immediately appear at Registered Teams.
4. Instruct (up to 11) runners (by March 8) and (2) volunteers (by April 15) to select your team name when registering.
   If every runner on a team lives more than 50 miles from any part of the course, the volunteer requirement is 
   waived. Since a waiver is involved, captains that enter their runners or volunteers assume personal liability
   for each person entered. 
5. Captains may view offline fundraising, change divisions and delete runners or volunteers (for substitutions). 
   [Send](about/who_we_are.html) $25 to change a team name or $100 to change a start time. 
6. By April 15, two volunteers, age 16 or older, must register for a 4-5 hour shift. 
   Volunteers may select their assignments when they register. When filled, an assignment will disappear from the list.
   Teams will be disqualified if their volunteers fail to show.
7. The $600/team ($50/runner) mandatory fundraising for [ORU](http://therelay.com/re_contact.htm) is easily 
   accomplished by creating a [fundraising page](http://therelay.com/or_fundraising.htm) to tell your team story 
   and/or asking your employer to match your entry fee with a tax-deductible donation. 

## RUNNER REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. [LOGIN](http://www.therelay.com/app/site/login) to confirm your team's entry at 
   [Registered Teams](http://therelay.com/ru_teams.htm). 
2. If your team name is not visible when registering, the entry fee has not been processed. 
   Enter your average 10K pace for start time calculations. 

## VOLUNTEER REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS. Thanks for volunteering! 

1. Volunteers, age 16 or older, must register for a 4-5 hour shift. Teams will be disqualified if 
   their volunteers fail to show. 
2. Before registering, view [Volunteer Entry Information](http://therelay.com/vo_entry.htm) to choose 
   a location and shift. 
3. To affiliate with the correct team, confirm entry of your team at 
   [Registered Teams](http://therelay.com/ru_teams.htm) and select the exact team name when registering. 
   Select "unaffiliated" if volunteering without a team. 
4. [LOGIN](http://www.therelay.com/app/site/login) to change a shift based on availability. 
5. When a captain deletes a volunteer to be replaced, the shift becomes available to the public so the 
   replacement volunteer must register immediately if he/she desires the same shift. 
6. Assignments are made as volunteers register. When filled, a shift will disappear from the list. 
   After registering, confirm your [Volunteer Assignment](http://therelay.com/vo_assign.htm).
